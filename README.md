# Employee_Data_Analysis_Project

The dataset contains information about employees, their salaries, departments, and other personal details spread across multiple tables.

In this project, I am trying to analyze an Employee database. My focus is to:

Retrieve Specific Data: I am extracting specific information like employee names, departments, salaries, and hire dates using queries with filters like DISTINCT, WHERE, and ORDER BY.

Apply Data Filters: I am excluding certain data, such as filtering out employees by their first names, and focusing on employees with certain salary ranges or departments with fewer employees.

Aggregate Data: I am using aggregation techniques to count the number of employees in each department, find the highest and lowest salaries, and group data by department or salary ranges using GROUP BY and COUNT.

Sorting and Limiting Data: I am sorting data by salary or other attributes in descending or ascending order, and limiting the number of records retrieved using LIMIT.

Join Operations: I am joining multiple tables (Employee, Employee_Details, Basic_Pays) to extract detailed information, such as employee phone numbers, hire dates, or salary records based on common fields like Employee_id.

Pattern Matching: I am searching for employees whose first names contain specific letters using the LIKE operator for pattern matching.

Through these queries, I am analyzing employee-related data, exploring salary distributions, department headcounts, and tracking employee details across different tables. This helps me derive insights from the data, such as identifying employees with the highest salaries, understanding department-wise distributions, and spotting missing information like hire dates.
